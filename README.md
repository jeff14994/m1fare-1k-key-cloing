# Clone data to either gen1 or gen2 devices 
This project is to clone data to either gen1 or gen2 devices.

# Why this project?
The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the efficient cloning of data onto gen1 or gen2 devices. It offers a systematic approach that begins with differentiating the device generation, dumping necessary data, and executing appropriate commands. The project ensures that users can seamlessly clone their key fobs and offers solutions for common hitches in the process.
## How to distinguish if the device to be written is either gen1 or gen2?
```
# In pm3, Use this command to check if it's a gen1 card
# This could be a gen2 card if cgetblk command is not working
[usb] pm3 --> hf mf cgetblk --blk 0
[#] wupC1 error
[!!] ðŸš¨ Can't read block. error=-1

# Double check with the following command, if it works it's a gen2 card:
[usb] pm3 --> hf mf rdbl --blk 0 -k FFFFFFFFFFFF
```
## gen1 device is relatively easy to clone (compared to gen2 device)
### How to use?
1. Dump the file from the the key fob you want to clone by pm3
2. [Run this command](./gen1_card/clone_key.sh)
	- the filename: `/hf-mf-XXXXXXXX-dump.bin` is the dump binary from pm3 using command `hf mf dump`
	- `XXXXXXXX` is the uid you can get it when dumping data with pm3
## gen2 devices 
### There are two situations you might meet in gen2 device
1. If key A is all `FFFFFFFFFFFF`
	- Create the file with filename: `dump_data` -> we can get it by dumping from the key fob you want to clone with `hf mf dump`. And the format should be similar as [this example](./examples/dump_data.md)
	- [Run this command](./gen2_card/ring_with_all_key_A_FFFFFFFFFFFF/gen2card_clone.sh)
		- connect to pm3 before running this command 
2. If key A is random in each sector, follow the instructions below
### key A is random in each sector
#### Two important files are needed to be created
1. The filename: `find_keys` -> can get it by pm3 with command `hf mf autopwn`
	- the `find_keys` format should be similar as [this example](./examples/find_keys.md). We are using key A to read and write the data to specific block
		- e.g key A at `Sec 000` is to unlock `block0-3` and so on
		- command examples: 
			- READ: `hf mf rdbl --blk 0 -k ffffffffffff` ~ `hf mf rdbl --blk 3 -k ffffffffffff`
			- WRITE: `hf mf wrbl --blk 0 -k ffffffffffff -d 0102030405` ~ `hf mf wrbl --blk 3 -k ffffffffffff -d 0102030405`
2. The filename: `dump_data` -> we can get it by dumping from the key fob you want to clone with `hf mf dump`. And the format should be similar as [this example](./examples/dump_data.md)
#### How to use? [Code base](./gen2_card/ring_with_specific_key_A)
1. Connect with pm3
2. `parse_dump.sh`
	- parse the [data](./examples/dump_data.md) dumped from pm3 
	- Input: `dump_data`, output: `parse_dump`
3. `parse_keys.sh`
	- parse the key dumped from pm3
		- Remember to input the **idential format** of find_keys mentioned [here](./examples/find_keys.md) 
	- Input: `find_keys`, outpus: `parsed_keys`
4. `gen2card_clone_key_fob.sh`
	- Clone the key fob
	- Input: `dump_data` and `parsed_keys`, no output
## Troublshooting
If the key fob is not able to unlock the door (and the reader shows yellow light), the block0 is probably wrong (SAK)
- Mediation: change from `SAK 88` to `SAK 08`
	- Change from `XXXXXXXXXX88XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` to `XXXXXXXXXX08XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` and write it with commands: `hf mf wrbl --blk 0 -k ffffffffffff -d XXXXXXXXXX08XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
